  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Minimally invasive needle-based interventions are
               commonly used in cancer diagnosis and treatment, including
               procedures, such as biopsy, brachytherapy, and microwave
               ablation. Although MR-guided needle placement offers several
               distinct advantages, such as high-resolution target visualization
               and accurate device tracking, one of the primary limitations that
               affect its widespread adoption is the ergonomic constraints of
               the closed-bore MRI environment, requiring the patients to be
               frequently moved in and out to perform the needle-based
               procedures. This paper introduces a low-profile, body-mounted,
               MR-guided robot designed to address this limitation by
               streamlining the operation workflow and enabling accurate needle
               placement within the MRI scanner. METHODS: The robot employs
               piezoelectric linear actuators and stacked Cartesian XY stages to
               precisely control the position and orientation of a needle guide.
               A kinematic model and control framework was developed to
               facilitate accurate targeting. Additionally, clinical workflow
               for the liver interventions was developed to demonstrate the
               robot's capability to replicate existing procedures. The proposed
               system was validated in benchtop environment and 3T MRI scanner
               to quantify the system performance. RESULTS: Experimental
               validations conducted in free space demonstrated a position
               accuracy of 2.38 ± 0.94 mm and orientation error of 1.40 ± 2.89°.
               Additional tests to confirm MR-conditionality and MR-guided
               phantom placements were carried out to assess the system's
               performance and safety in MRI suite, yielding a position error of
               2.01 ± 0.77 mm and an orientation error of 1.57 ± 1.31°.
               CONCLUSION: The presented robot shows exceptional compatibility
               with a wide range of patients and bore sizes while maintaining
               clinically significant accuracy. Future work will focus on the
               validations in dynamic liver environments.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For the augmented reality of surgical
               navigation, which overlays a 3D model of the surgical target on
               an image, accurate camera calibration is imperative. However,
               when the checkerboard images for calibration are captured using a
               surgical microscope having high magnification, blur owing to the
               narrow depth of focus and blocking artifacts caused by limited
               resolution around the fine edges occur. These artifacts strongly
               affect the localization of corner points of the checkerboard in
               these images, resulting in inaccurate calibration, which leads to
               a large displacement in augmented reality. To solve this problem,
               in this study, we proposed a novel target-specific deep learning
               network that simultaneously enhances both the blur and spatial
               resolution of an image for surgical zoom lens camera calibration.
               METHODS: As a scheme of an end-to-end convolutional deep neural
               network, the proposed network is specifically intended for the
               checkerboard image enhancement used in camera calibration.
               Through the symmetric architecture of the network, which consists
               of encoding and decoding layers, the distinctive spatial features
               of the encoding layers are transferred and merged with the output
               of the decoding layers. Additionally, by integrating a
               multi-frame framework including subpixel motion estimation and
               ideal reference image with the symmetric architecture, joint
               image deblurring and enhanced resolution were efficiently
               achieved. RESULTS: From experimental comparisons, we verified the
               capability of the proposed method to improve the subjective and
               objective performances of surgical microscope calibration.
               Furthermore, we confirmed that the augmented reality overlap
               ratio, which quantitatively indicates augmented reality accuracy,
               from calibration with the enhanced image of the proposed method
               is higher than that of the previous methods. CONCLUSIONS: These
               findings suggest that the proposed network provides sharp
               high-resolution images from blurry low-resolution inputs.
               Furthermore, we demonstrate superior performance in camera
               calibration by using surgical microscopic images, thus showing
               its potential applications in the field of practical surgical
               navigation.",

SlicerROS2 is a software module that combines 3D Slicer and robot operating system (ROS) in pursuit of a standard integration approach for medical robotics research. The first release of SlicerROS2 demonstrated the feasibility of using the C++ API from 3D Slicer and ROS to load and visualize robots in real time. Since this initial release, we’ve rewritten and redesigned the module to offer greater modularity, access to low-level features, access to 3D Slicer’s Python API, and better data transfer protocols. In this paper, we introduce this new design as well as four applications that leverage the core functionalities of SlicerROS2 in realistic image-guided robotics scenarios.},

   abstract = "BACKGROUND: Percutaneous microwave ablation (pMWA) is a minimally
               invasive procedure that uses a microwave antenna placed at the
               tip of a needle to induce lethal tissue heating. It can treat
               cancer and other diseases with lower morbidity than conventional
               surgery, but one major limitation is the lack of control over the
               heating region around the ablation needle. Superparamagnetic iron
               oxide nanoparticles have the potential to enhance and control
               pMWA heating due to their ability to absorb microwave energy and
               their ease of local delivery. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study
               is to experimentally quantify the capabilities of FDA-approved
               superparamagnetic iron oxide Feraheme nanoparticles (FHNPs) to
               enhance and control pMWA heating. This study aims to determine
               the effectiveness of locally injected FHNPs in increasing the
               maximum temperature during pMWA and to investigate the ability of
               FHNPs to create a controlled ablation zone around the pMWA
               needle. METHODS: PMWA was performed using a clinical ablation
               system at 915 MHz in ex-vivo porcine liver tissues. Prior to
               ablation, 50 uL 5 mg/mL FHNP injections were made on one side of
               the pMWA needle via a 23-gauge needle. Local temperatures at the
               FHNP injection site were directly compared to equidistant control
               sites without FHNP. First, temperatures were compared using
               directly inserted thermocouples. Next, temperatures were measured
               non-invasively using magnetic resonance thermometry (MRT), which
               enabled comprehensive four-dimensional (volumetric and temporal)
               assessment of heating effects relative to nanoparticle
               distribution, which was quantified using dual-echo ultrashort
               echo time (UTE) subtraction MR imaging. Maximum heating within
               FHNP-exposed tissues versus control tissues were compared at
               multiple pMWA energy delivery settings. The ability to generate a
               controlled asymmetric ablation zone using multiple FHNP
               injections was also tested. Finally, intra-procedural MRT-derived
               heat maps were correlated with gold standard gross pathology
               using Dice similarity analysis. RESULTS: Maximum temperatures at
               the FHNP injection site were significantly higher than control
               (without FHNP) sites when measured using direct thermocouples
               (93.1 $\pm$ 6.0°C vs. 57.2 $\pm$ 8.1°C, p = 0.002) and using
               non-invasive MRT (115.6 $\pm$ 13.4°C vs. 49.0 $\pm$ 10.6°C, p =
               0.02). Temperature difference between FHNP-exposed and control
               sites correlated with total energy deposition: 66.6 $\pm$ 17.6°C,
               58.1 $\pm$ 8.5°C, and 20.8 $\pm$ 9.2°C at high (17.5 $\pm$ 2.2
               kJ), medium (13.6 $\pm$ 1.8 kJ), and low (8.8 $\pm$ 1.1 kJ)
               energies, respectively (all pairwise p < 0.05). Each FHNP
               injection resulted in a nanoparticle distribution within 0.9
               $\pm$ 0.2 cm radially of the injection site and a local lethal
               heating zone confined to within 1.1 $\pm$ 0.4 cm radially of the
               injection epicenter. Multiple injections enabled a controllable,
               asymmetric ablation zone to be generated around the ablation
               needle, with maximal ablation radius on the FHNP injection side
               of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.2 cm compared to 0.7 $\pm$ 0.2 cm on the non-FHNP
               side (p = 0.02). MRT intra-procedural predicted ablation zone
               correlated strongly with post procedure gold-standard gross
               pathology assessment (Dice similarity 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Locally
               injected FHNPs significantly enhanced pMWA heating in liver
               tissues, and were able to control the ablation zone shape around
               a pMWA needle. MRI and MRT allowed volumetric real-time
               visualization of both FHNP distribution and FHNP-enhanced pMWA
               heating that was useful for intra-procedural monitoring. This
               work strongly supports further development of a FHNP-enhanced
               pMWA paradigm; as all individual components of this approach are
               approved for patient use, there is low barrier for clinical
               translation.",

   abstract = "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Focal therapies have emerged as
               minimally invasive alternatives for patients with localized
               low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) and those with postradiation
               recurrence. Among the available focal treatment methods for PCa,
               cryoablation offers several technical advantages, including the
               visibility of the boundaries of frozen tissue on the
               intraprocedural images, access to anterior lesions, and the
               proven ability to treat postradiation recurrence. However,
               predicting the final volume of the frozen tissue is challenging
               as it depends on several patient-specific factors, such as
               proximity to heat sources and thermal properties of the prostatic
               tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper presents a
               convolutional neural network model based on 3D-Unet to predict
               the frozen isotherm boundaries (iceball) resultant from a given a
               cryo-needle placement. Intraprocedural magnetic resonance images
               acquired during 38 cases of focal cryoablation of PCa were
               retrospectively used to train and validate the model. The model
               accuracy was assessed and compared against a vendor-provided
               geometrical model, which is used as a guideline in routine
               procedures. RESULTS: The mean Dice Similarity Coefficient using
               the proposed model was 0.79$\pm$0.08 (mean+SD) vs 0.72$\pm$0.06
               using the geometrical model (P<.001). CONCLUSION: The model
               provided an accurate iceball boundary prediction in less than
               0.4second and has proven its feasibility to be implemented in an
               intraprocedural planning algorithm.",

               electrophysiological (EP) interventions for radiofrequency (500
               kHz) ablation (RFA) of arrythmia. Requirements include imaging at
               three to five times surface-coil SNR in cardiac chambers,
               vascular insertion, steerable-active-navigation into cardiac
               chambers, operation with ablation catheters, and safe levels of
               MR-induced heating. METHODS: ICMRI's 6 mm outer-diameter (OD)
               metallic-braided shaft had a 2.6 mm OD internal lumen for
               ablation-catheter insertion. Miniature-Baluns (MBaluns) on
               ICMRI's 1 m shaft reduced body-coil-induced heating. Distal
               section was a folded ``star''-shaped imaging-coil mounted on an
               expandable frame, with an integrated miniature
               low-noise-amplifier overcoming cable losses. A handle-activated
               movable-shaft expanded imaging-coil to 35 mm OD for imaging
               within cardiac-chambers. Four MR-tracking micro-coils enabled
               navigation and motion-compensation, assuming a tetrahedron-shape
               when expanded. A second handle-lever enabled distal-tip
               deflection. ICMRI with a protruding deflectable EP catheter were
               used for MR-tracked navigation and RFA using a dedicated
               3D-slicer user-interface. ICMRI was tested at 3T and 1.5T in
               swine to evaluate (a) heating, (b) cardiac-chamber access, (c)
               imaging field-of-view and SNR, and (d) intraprocedural RFA lesion
               monitoring. RESULTS: The 3T and 1.5T imaging SNR demonstrated
               >400\% SNR boost over a 4 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4 cm3 FOV in the
               heart, relative to body and spine arrays. ICMRI with MBaluns met
               ASTM/IEC heating limits during navigation. Tip-deflection allowed
               navigating ICMRI and EP catheter into atria and ventricles.

               MRF experiments were performed on 5 different 3 Tesla MRI
               scanners at 3 different institutions: University Hospitals
               Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH), Brigham and Women's

               compared using the intraclass correlation coefficient and
               Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The intrascanner variation of
               values measured using MRF was less than 2\% for T1 and 4.7\% for
               T2 for relaxation values, within the range of 307.7 to 2360 ms
               for T1 and 19.1 to 248.5 ms for T2 . Interscanner measurements
               showed that the T1 variation was less than 4.9\%, and T2
               variation was less than 8.1\% between multicenter scanners. Both
               T1 and T2 values in in vivo prostatic tissue demonstrated high
               test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >
               0.92) and strong linear correlation (R2 > 0.840). CONCLUSION:

               metric to evaluate the diagnostic quality of multiparametric
               magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate. This study
               assesses the impact of an intervention, namely a prostate MRI
               quality training lecture, on the participant's ability to apply
               PI-QUAL. METHODS: Sixteen participants (radiologists, urologists,
               physicists, and computer scientists) of varying experience in
               reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI all assessed the image quality
               of ten examinations from different vendors and machines. Then,
               they attended a dedicated lecture followed by a hands-on workshop
               on MRI quality assessment using the PI-QUAL score. Five scans
               assessed by the participants were evaluated in the workshop using
               the PI-QUAL score for teaching purposes. After the course, the
               same participants evaluated the image quality of a new set of ten
               scans applying the PI-QUAL score. Results were assessed using
               receiver operating characteristic analysis. The reference
               standard was the PI-QUAL score assessed by one of the developers
               of PI-QUAL. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in
               average area under the curve for the evaluation of image quality
               from baseline (0.59 [95 \% confidence intervals: 0.50-0.66]) to
               post-teaching (0.96 [0.92-0.98]), an improvement of 0.37

               (dedicated lecture + hands-on workshop) on PI-QUAL significantly
               improved the application of this scoring system to assess the
               quality of prostate MRI examinations. KEY POINTS: • A significant
               improvement in the application of PI-QUAL for the assessment of
               prostate MR image quality was observed after an educational
               intervention. • Appropriate training on image quality can be
               delivered to those involved in the acquisition and interpretation
               of prostate MRI. • Further investigation will be needed to
               understand the impact on improving the acquisition of

               inserting a needle manually through a needle guide. If the needle
               is deviated from the intended path, actuators shifts the needle
               radially in order to steer the needle trajectory and compensate
               for needle deviation adaptively. The needle guide is controlled
               by a new data-driven algorithm which does not requirea
               prioriinformation about needle or tissue properties. The method

               advanced interstitial cervical cancer bracytherapy treatment,
               this is performed by placing a metallic rod (``stylet'') inside a
               hollow cylindrical tube (``catheter'') and advancing the pair to
               the desired target. The stylet is removed once the target is
               reached, followed by the insertion of radiation sources into the
               catheter. However, manually advancing an initially straight
               stylet into the tumor with millimeter spatial accuracy has been a
               long-standing challenge, which requires multiple insertions and
               retractions, due to the unforeseen stylet deflection caused by
               the stiff muscle tissue that is traversed. In this paper, we
               develop a novel tendon-actuated deflectable stylet equipped with

   abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A major obstacle to improving bedside neurosurgical
               procedure safety and accuracy with image guidance technologies is
               the lack of a rapidly deployable, real-time registration and
               tracking system for a moving patient. This deficiency explains
               the persistence of freehand placement of external ventricular
               drains, which has an inherent risk of inaccurate positioning,
               multiple passes, tract hemorrhage, and injury to adjacent brain
               parenchyma. Here, the authors introduce and validate a novel
               image registration and real-time tracking system for frameless
               stereotactic neuronavigation and catheter placement in the
               nonimmobilized patient. METHODS: Computer vision technology was
               used to develop an algorithm that performed near-continuous,
               automatic, and marker-less image registration. The program fuses
               a subject's preprocedure CT scans to live 3D camera images
               (Snap-Surface), and patient movement is incorporated by
               artificial intelligence-driven recalibration (Real-Track). The
               surface registration error (SRE) and target registration error
               (TRE) were calculated for 5 cadaveric heads that underwent serial
               movements (fast and slow velocity roll, pitch, and yaw motions)
               and several test conditions, such as surgical draping with
               limited anatomical exposure and differential subject lighting.
               Six catheters were placed in each cadaveric head (30 total
               placements) with a simulated sterile technique. Postprocedure CT
               scans allowed comparison of planned and actual catheter positions
               for user error calculation. RESULTS: Registration was successful
               for all 5 cadaveric specimens, with an overall mean ($\pm$
               standard deviation) SRE of 0.429 $\pm$ 0.108 mm for the catheter
               placements. Accuracy of TRE was maintained under 1.2 mm
               throughout specimen movements of low and high velocities of roll,
               pitch, and yaw, with the slowest recalibration time of 0.23
               seconds. There were no statistically significant differences in
               SRE when the specimens were draped or fully undraped (p = 0.336).
               Performing registration in a bright versus a dimly lit
               environment had no statistically significant effect on SRE (p =
               0.742 and 0.859, respectively). For the catheter placements, mean
               TRE was 0.862 $\pm$ 0.322 mm and mean user error (difference
               between target and actual catheter tip) was 1.674 $\pm$ 1.195 mm.
               CONCLUSIONS: This computer vision-based registration system
               provided real-time tracking of cadaveric heads with a
               recalibration time of less than one-quarter of a second with
               submillimetric accuracy and enabled catheter placements with
               millimetric accuracy. Using this approach to guide bedside
               ventriculostomy could reduce complications, improve safety, and
               be extrapolated to other frameless stereotactic applications in
               awake, nonimmobilized patients.",

               of those structures, namely the neurovascular bundles (NVB) and
               the external urethral sphincters (EUS), can enable physicians to
               perform such assessments intuitively. As a crucial step to
               generate a patient-specific anatomical model from preoperative
               MRI in a clinical routine, we propose a multi-class automatic
               segmentation based on an anisotropic convolutional network. Our
               specific challenge is to train the network model on a unique
               source dataset only available at a single clinical site and
               deploy it to another target site without sharing the original
               images or labels. As network models trained on data from a single
               source suffer from quality loss due to the domain shift, we
               propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA) method to refine
               the model's performance in the target domain. Our DA method
               combines transfer learning and uncertainty guided self-learning
               based on deep ensembles. Experiments on the segmentation of the
               prostate, NVB, and EUS, show significant performance gain with
               the combination of those techniques compared to pure TL and the
               combination of TL with simple self-learning ([Formula: see text]

               on a different task and data (Pancreas CT segmentation)
               demonstrate our method's generic application capabilities. Our
               method has the advantage that it does not require any further
               data from the source domain, unlike the majority of recent domain
               adaptation strategies. This makes our method suitable for

   abstract = "PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transperineal
               prostate biopsy has been practiced since the early 2000s. The
               technique often suffers from targeting error due to deviation of
               the needle as a result of physical interaction between the needle
               and inhomogeneous tissues. Existing needle guide devices, such as
               a grid template, do not allow choosing an alternative insertion
               path to mitigate the deviation because of their limited
               degree-of-freedom (DoF). This study evaluates how an angulated
               needle insertion path can reduce needle deviation and improve
               needle placement accuracy. METHODS: We extended a robotic
               needle-guidance device (Smart Template) for in-bore MRI-guided
               transperineal prostate biopsy. The new Smart Template has a 4-DoF
               needle-guiding mechanism allowing a translational range of motion
               of 65 and 58 mm along the vertical and horizontal axis, and a
               needle rotational motion around the vertical and horizontal axis
               $\pm$ 30 ∘ and a vertical rotational range of - 30 ∘ , + 10 ∘ ,
               respectively. We defined a path planning strategy, which chooses
               between straight and angulated insertion paths depending on the
               anatomical structures on the potential insertion path. We
               performed (a) a set of experiments to evaluate the device
               positioning accuracy outside the MR-bore, and (b) an in vivo
               experiment to evaluate the improvement of targeting accuracy
               combining straight and angulated insertions in animal models
               (swine, n = 3 ). RESULTS: We analyzed 46 in vivo insertions using
               either straight or angulated insertions paths. The experiment
               showed that the proposed strategy of selecting straight or
               angulated insertions based on the subject's anatomy outperformed
               the conventional approach of just straight insertions in terms of
               targeting accuracy (2.4 mm [1.3-3.7] vs 3.9 mm [2.4-5.0] \{Median
               IQR \} ); p = 0.041 after the bias correction). CONCLUSION: The
               in vivo experiment successfully demonstrated that an angulated
               needle insertion path could improve needle placement accuracy

               guidance for prostate cancer surgery. OBJECTIVE: In this review,
               we aim to present the impact of 3D printing, virtual reality
               (VR), and augmented reality (AR) techniques for prostate cancer
               procedures, specifically prostate biopsy and radical
               prostatectomy (RP). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was
               performed by two investigators according to the Preferred
               Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
               criteria. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 541 papers were
               identified in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. Of these, 53 studies
               were identified for detailed review and 25 were qualified. Two
               more studies were identified from the references; thus, 27
               studies were finally included in this systematic review. Nine
               papers reported on the use of 3D reconstructed models, mainly in
               education/training and intraoperative guidance; nine reported on
               VR, focusing on simulation training model and intraoperative
               guidance; and nine reported on AR technique with its best
               indication for surgical guidance in robotic RP. CONCLUSIONS:
               Three-dimensional visualization techniques have gradually been
               introduced and developed in prostate procedures, and demonstrate
               potential utility not only for education/training, but also for
               surgical planning and intraoperative guidance. Prospective
               studies are needed to demonstrate clinical utility and validation
               of these technologies. PATIENT SUMMARY: Despite low-quality
               evidence, promising signals were identified to demonstrate that
               three-dimensional visualization could help facilitate prostate
               procedures, in terms of education/training, surgical planning,
               and intraoperative guidance. It is still in a very early stage,

   abstract = "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: There have been multiple investigations
               defining and reporting the effectiveness of focal cryoablation as
               a treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer. However,
               the impact of cryo-needle/probe placement accuracy within the
               tumor and gland has not been extensively studied. We analyzed how
               variations in the placement of the cryo-needles, specifically
               errors leading to incomplete ablation, may affect prostate
               cancer's resulting cryoablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
               performed a study based on isothermal models using Monte Carlo
               simulations to analyze the impact of needle placement errors on
               tumor coverage and the probability of positive ablation margin.
               We modeled the placement error as a Gaussian noise on the
               cryo-needle position. The analysis used retrospective MRI data of
               15 patients with biopsy-proven, unifocal, and MRI visible
               prostate cancer to calculate the impact of placement error on the
               volume of the tumor encompassed by the -40°C and -20°C isotherms
               using one to four cryo-needles. RESULTS: When the standard
               deviation of the placement error reached 3 mm, the tumor coverage
               was still above 97\% with the -20°C isotherm, and above 81\% with
               the -40°C isotherm using two cryo-needles or more. The
               probability of positive margin was significantly lower

               The results indicated that accurate cryo-needle placement is
               essential for the success of focal cryoablation of prostate
               cancer. The analysis shows that an admissible targeting error

   abstract = "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop a method to
               delineate the lethally frozen-tissue region (temperature less
               than -40°C) arising from interventional cryoablation procedures
               using a short tau inversion-recovery ultrashort echo-time
               (STIR-UTE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence. This method
               could serve as an intraprocedural validation of the completion of
               tumor ablation, reducing the number of local recurrences after
               cryoablation procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method relies
               on the short T1 and T2* relaxation times of frozen soft tissue.
               Pointwise Encoding Time with Radial Acquisition, a 3-dimensional
               UTE sequence with TE = 70 microseconds, was optimized with STIR
               to null tissues with a T1 of approximately 271 milliseconds, the
               threshold T1. Because the T1 relaxation time of frozen tissue in
               the temperature range of -40°C < temperature < -8°C is shorter
               than the threshold T1 at the 3-tesla magnetic field, tissues in
               this range should appear hyperintense. The sequence was evaluated
               in ex vivo frozen tissue, where image intensity and actual tissue
               temperatures, measured by thermocouples, were correlated.
               Thereafter, the sequence was evaluated clinically in 12 MR-guided
               prostate cancer cryoablations, where MR-compatible cryoprobes
               were used to destroy cancerous tissue and preserve surrounding
               normal tissue. RESULTS: The ex vivo experiment using a bovine
               muscle demonstrated that STIR-UTE images showed regions
               approximately between -40°C and -8°C as hyperintense, with
               tissues at lower and higher temperatures appearing dark, making
               it possible to identify the region likely to be above the lethal
               temperature inside the frozen tissue. In the clinical cases, the
               STIR-UTE images showed a dark volume centered on the cryoprobe
               shaft, Vinner, where the temperature is likely below -40°C,
               surrounded by a doughnut-shaped hyperintense volume, where the
               temperature is likely between -40°C and -8°C. The hyperintense
               region was itself surrounded by a dark volume, where the
               temperature is likely above -8°C, permitting calculation of
               Vouter. The STIR-UTE frozen-tissue volumes, Vinner and Vouter,
               appeared significantly smaller than signal voids on turbo spin
               echo images (P < 1.0 $\times$ 10), which are currently used to
               quantify the frozen-tissue volume (``the iceball''). The ratios
               of the Vinner and Vouter volumes to the iceball were 0.92 $\pm$
               0.08 and 0.29 $\pm$ 0.07, respectively. In a single postablation
               follow-up case, a strong correlation was seen between Vinner and
               the necrotic volume. CONCLUSIONS: Short tau inversion-recovery
               ultrashort echo-time MR imaging successfully delineated the area
               approximately between -40°C and -8°C isotherms in the frozen

   abstract = "PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided percutaneous
               cryotherapy of abdominal lesions, an established procedure, uses
               MRI to guide and monitor the cryoablation of lesions. Methods to
               precisely guide cryotherapy probes with a minimum amount of
               trial-and-error are yet to be established. To aid physicians in
               attaining precise probe alignment without trial-and-error, a
               body-mounted motorized cryotherapy-probe alignment device
               (BMCPAD) with motion compensation was clinically tested in this
               study. The study also compared the contribution of body motion
               and organ motion compensation to the guidance accuracy of a
               body-mounted probe alignment device. METHODS: The accuracy of
               guidance using the BMCPAD was prospectively measured during
               MRI-guided percutaneous cryotherapies before insertion of the
               probes. Clinical parameters including patient age, types of
               anesthesia, depths of the target, and organ sites of target were
               collected. By using MR images of the target organs and fiducial
               markers embedded in the BMCPAD, we retrospectively simulated the
               guidance accuracy with body motion compensation, organ motion
               compensation, and no compensation. The collected data were
               analyzed to test the impact of motion compensation on the
               guidance accuracy. RESULTS: Thirty-seven physical guidance of
               probes were prospectively recorded for sixteen completed cases.
               The accuracy of physical guidance using the BMCPAD was 13.4 $\pm$
               11.1 mm. The simulated accuracy of guidance with body motion
               compensation, organ motion compensation, and no compensation was
               2.4 $\pm$ 2.9 mm, 2.2 $\pm$ 1.6 mm, and 3.5 $\pm$ 2.9 mm,
               respectively. Data analysis revealed that the body motion
               compensation and organ motion compensation individually impacted
               the improvement in the accuracy of simulated guidance. Moreover,
               the difference in the accuracy of guidance either by body motion
               compensation or organ motion compensation was not statistically
               significant. The major clinical parameters impacting the accuracy
               of guidance were the body and organ motions. Patient age, types
               of anesthesia, depths of the target, and organ sites of target
               did not influence the accuracy of guidance using BMCPAD. The
               magnitude of body surface movement and organ movement exhibited
               mutual statistical correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The BMCPAD
               demonstrated guidance accuracy comparable to that of previously
               reported devices for CT-guided procedures. The analysis using
               simulated motion compensation revealed that body motion
               compensation and organ motion compensation individually impact
               the improvement in the accuracy of device-guided cryotherapy
               probe alignment. Considering the correlation between body and
               organ movements, we also determined that body motion compensation
               using the ring fiducial markers in the BMCPAD can be solely used
               to address both body and organ motions in MRI-guided cryotherapy.",

   abstract = "PURPOSE: Image guidance is crucial for percutaneous tumor
               ablations, enabling accurate needle-like applicator placement
               into target tumors while avoiding tissues that are sensitive to
               injury and/or correcting needle deflection. Although ultrasound
               (US) is widely used for image guidance, magnetic resonance (MR)
               is preferable due to its superior soft tissue contrast. The
               objective of this study was to develop and evaluate an MR and US
               multi-modal image-guided navigation system with a needle
               manipulator to enable US-guided applicator placement during MR
               imaging (MRI)-guided percutaneous tumor ablation. METHODS: The
               MRI-compatible needle manipulator with US probe was installed
               adjacent to a 3 Tesla MRI scanner patient table. Coordinate
               systems for the MR image, patient table, manipulator, and US
               probe were all registered using an optical tracking sensor. The
               patient was initially scanned in the MRI scanner bore for
               planning and then moved outside the bore for treatment. Needle
               insertion was guided by real-time US imaging fused with the
               reformatted static MR image to enhance soft tissue contrast.
               Feasibility, targeting accuracy, and MR compatibility of the
               system were evaluated using a bovine liver and agar phantoms.
               RESULTS: Targeting error for 50 needle insertions was 1.6 $\pm$
               0.6 mm (mean $\pm$ standard deviation). The experiment confirmed
               that fused MR and US images provided real-time needle
               localization against static MR images with soft tissue contrast.
               CONCLUSIONS: The proposed MR and US multi-modal image-guided
               navigation system using a needle manipulator enabled accurate
               needle insertion by taking advantage of static MR and real-time
               US images simultaneously. Real-time visualization helped
               determine needle depth, tissue monitoring surrounding the needle

               (tpMRgBx) is a targeted biopsy technique that was shown to be
               safe, efficient, and accurate. Our goal was to develop an open
               source software platform to support evaluation, refinement, and
               translation of this biopsy approach. METHODS: We developed
               SliceTracker, a 3D Slicer extension to support tpMRgBx. We
               followed modular design of the implementation to enable
               customization of the interface and interchange of image
               segmentation and registration components to assess their effect
               on the processing time, precision, and accuracy of the biopsy

               developed to enable the use of software by an operator with
               minimal technical training to facilitate translation.
               Retrospective evaluation studied registration accuracy, effect of
               the prostate segmentation approach, and re-identification time of
               biopsy targets. Prospective evaluation focused on the total
               procedure time and biopsy targeting error (BTE). RESULTS:
               Evaluation utilized data from 73 retrospective and ten
               prospective tpMRgBx cases. Mean landmark registration error for
               retrospective evaluation was 1.88 $\pm$ 2.63 mm, and was not

               experience and intelligence in a controlled, closed-loop fashion.
               Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal modality for
               surgical guidance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, with
               its ability to perform high resolution, real-time, high soft
               tissue contrast imaging without ionizing radiation. However, for
               most current image-guided approaches only static pre-operative
               images are accessible for guidance, which are unable to provide
               updated information during a surgical procedure. The high
               magnetic field, electrical interference, and limited access of
               closed-bore MRI render great challenges to developing robotic
               systems that can perform inside a diagnostic high-field MRI while
               obtaining interactively updated MR images. To overcome these
               limitations, we are developing a piezoelectrically actuated
               robotic assistant for actuated percutaneous prostate
               interventions under real-time MRI guidance. Utilizing a modular
               design, the system enables coherent and straight forward workflow
               for various percutaneous interventions, including prostate biopsy
               sampling and brachytherapy seed placement, using various needle
               driver configurations. The unified workflow compromises: 1)
               system hardware and software initialization, 2) fiducial frame
               registration, 3) target selection and motion planning, 4) moving
               to the target and performing the intervention (e.g. taking a
               biopsy sample) under live imaging, and 5) visualization and
               verification. Phantom experiments of prostate biopsy and
               brachytherapy were executed under MRI-guidance to evaluate the
               feasibility of the workflow. The robot successfully performed
               fully actuated biopsy sampling and delivery of simulated
               brachytherapy seeds under live MR imaging, as well as precise
               delivery of a prostate brachytherapy seed distribution with an

               invasive surgical instruments, where the goal is to create
               slimline devices that can be inserted through small incisions.
               Origami also has the potential to cut costs by reducing the
               amount of material required for assembly. Origami devices are
               especially suitable for MRI-guided procedures, where instruments
               must be nonmagnetic because origami is more suitable for
               flexible, non-metallic materials. MR conditional surgical
               instruments enable intraoperative MRI procedures that provide
               superior imaging capabilities to physicians to allow for safer
               procedures. This work presents an MR conditional joint developed
               using origami techniques that reduces costs by eliminating
               assembly of various components and has potential applications in
               endoscopy. The joint is a compliant rolling-contact element that
               employs curved-folding origami techniques. A chain of these
               joints can be constructed from a single sheet of material,
               eliminating assembly of numerous materials to produce a final
               product, which is specifically advantageous for constructing
               low-cost, disposable surgical devices. The prototype contains a
               degree of bending of $\pm$9 degrees per joint, a response time of
               less than 4 seconds and an actuation force of 0.5 N using a 1.25
               A current. The MRI results showed a minimal artifact of less than
               1 mm measured from the boundary of the joint chain and a SNR

                The protocol provides a standardized mechanism to connect
                hardware and software by the transfer of coordinate transforms,
                images, and status messages. MeVisLab is a framework for the
                development of image processing algorithms and visualization and
                interaction methods, with a focus on medical imaging. METHODS:
                The paper describes the integration of the OpenIGTLink network
                protocol for IGT with the medical prototyping platform MeVisLab.
                The integration of OpenIGTLink into MeVisLab has been realized
                by developing a software module using the C++ programming
                language. RESULTS: The integration was evaluated with tracker
                clients that are available online. Furthermore, the integration
                was used to connect MeVisLab to Slicer and a NDI tracking system
                over the network. The latency time during navigation with a real
                instrument was measured to show that the integration can be used

                interface their software to hardware devices that already

                standardized communication among devices and software to share
                data such as target positions, images and device status. METHOD:
                We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network
                communication protocol for IGT, named OpenIGTLink, to transfer
                transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance
                tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering
                scenarios. RESULTS: The protocol was able to transfer position
                data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with
                latency of <10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated
                that the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and

                data required in the IGT setting with sufficient time resolution

               Augmentation of the Mono-Exponential (GAME) decay model, in the

               AICC ), in skeletal muscle, the prostate central gland (CG), and
               peripheral zone (PZ) regions of interest (ROIs). The GAME model
               had higher information content in 30\% of the prostate on average
               (across all patients and ROIs), covering up to 67\% of cancerous
               PZ ROIs, and up to 100\% of cancerous CG ROIs (in individual
               patients). The higher information content of GAME became more
               prominent in regions that would be assumed hypoxic using ME
               alone, reaching 50\% of the PZ and 70\% of the CG as ME R2 (*)

               could mask differences in parameters due to underlying tissue
               anatomy or physiology. The GAME model improves characterization
               of signal behavior in the prostate at 3T, and may increase the

               transperineal prostate biopsies in patients using a 4
               degrees-of-freedom (DoF) MRI-compatible robot. The anatomical
               structures in the pelvic area and the needle path were
               reconstructed from MR images, and quantitatively analyzed. We
               analyzed each structure individually and also proposed a
               mathematical model to investigate the influence of those
               structures in the targeting error using the mixed-model
               regression. The median targeting error in 188 insertions (27
               patients) was 6.3 mm. Both the individual anatomical structure
               analysis and the mixed-model analysis showed that the deviation
               resulted from the contact between the needle and the skin as the
               main source of error. On contrary, needle bending inside the
               tissue (expressed as needle curvature) did not vary among
               insertions with targeting errors above and below the average. The
               analysis indicated that insertions crossing the bulbospongiosus
               presented a targeting error lower than the average. The
               mixed-model analysis demonstrated that the distance between the
               needle guide and the patient skin, the deviation at the entry
               point, and the path length inside the pelvic diaphragm had a
               statistically significant contribution to the targeting error (p
               < 0.05). Our results indicate that the errors associated with the
               elastic contact between the needle and the skin were more
               prominent than the needle bending along the insertion. Our
               findings will help to improve the preoperative planning of
               transperineal prostate biopsies.",

               patient, but by pairing closed-loop trajectory compensation with
               hands-on cooperatively controlled insertion, a physician's
               control of the procedure can be maintained while incorporating
               benefits of robotic accuracy. A series of needle insertions were
               performed with a typical 18G needle using closed-loop active
               compensation under both fully autonomous and user-directed

               are vulnerable to patient motion. The objective of this study is
               to develop and evaluate a software system for an MRI-compatible
               patient-mounted needle guide device that can adaptively
               compensate for displacement of the device due to patient motion
               using a novel image-based automatic device-to-image registration
               technique. We have developed a software system for an
               MRI-compatible patient-mounted needle guide device for
               percutaneous ablation. It features fully-automated image-based
               device-to-image registration to track the device position, and a
               device controller to adjust the needle trajectory to compensate
               for the displacement of the device. We performed: (a) a phantom
               study using a clinical MR scanner to evaluate registration
               performance; (b) simulations using intraoperative time-series MR
               data acquired in 20 clinical cases of MRI-guided renal
               cryoablations to assess its impact on motion compensation; and
               (c) a pilot clinical study in three patients to test its
               feasibility during the clinical procedure. FRE, TRE, and success
               rate of device-to-image registration were 2.71 $\pm$ 2.29 mm,
               1.74 $\pm$ 1.13 mm, and 98.3\% for the phantom images. The
               simulation study showed that the motion compensation reduced the
               targeting error for needle placement from 8.2 mm to 5.4 mm (p <
               0.0005) in patients under general anesthesia (GA), and from 14.4
               mm to 10.0 mm (p < 1.0 $\times$ 10(−5)) in patients under
               monitored anesthesia care (MAC). The pilot study showed that the
               software registered the device successfully in a clinical
               setting. Our simulation study demonstrated that the software
               system could significantly improve targeting accuracy in patients
               treated under both MAC and GA. Intraprocedural image-based

   abstract = "PURPOSE: With the growing interest in advanced image-guidance for
               surgical robot systems, rapid integration and testing of robotic
               devices and medical image computing software are becoming
               essential in the research and development. Maximizing the use of
               existing engineering resources built on widely accepted platforms
               in different fields, such as robot operating system (ROS) in
               robotics and 3D Slicer in medical image computing could simplify
               these tasks. We propose a new open network bridge interface
               integrated in ROS to ensure seamless cross-platform data sharing.
               METHODS: A ROS node named ROS-IGTL-Bridge was implemented. It
               establishes a TCP/IP network connection between the ROS
               environment and external medical image computing software using
               the OpenIGTLink protocol. The node exports ROS messages to the
               external software over the network and vice versa simultaneously,
               allowing seamless and transparent data sharing between the
               ROS-based devices and the medical image computing platforms.
               RESULTS: Performance tests demonstrated that the bridge could
               stream transforms, strings, points, and images at 30 fps in both
               directions successfully. The data transfer latency was <1.2 ms
               for transforms, strings and points, and 25.2 ms for color VGA
               images. A separate test also demonstrated that the bridge could
               achieve 900 fps for transforms. Additionally, the bridge was
               demonstrated in two representative systems: a mock image-guided
               surgical robot setup consisting of 3D slicer, and Lego Mindstorms
               with ROS as a prototyping and educational platform for IGT
               research; and the smart tissue autonomous robot surgical setup
               with 3D Slicer. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that the
               bridge enabled cross-platform data sharing between ROS and
               medical image computing software. This will allow rapid and
               seamless integration of advanced image-based planning/navigation
               offered by the medical image computing software such as 3D Slicer
               into ROS-based surgical robot systems.",

               the adequacy of ablation margin after liver ablation for early
               prediction of local recurrence. However, quantitative assessment
               of the ablation margin by comparing pre- and post-procedural
               images remains challenging. We developed and tested a novel
               method for three-dimensional quantitative assessment of ablation
               margin based on non-rigid image registration and 3D distance map.
               METHODS: Our method was tested with pre- and post-procedural MR
               images acquired in 21 patients who underwent image-guided
               percutaneous liver ablation. The two images were co-registered
               using non-rigid intensity-based registration. After the tumor and
               ablation volumes were segmented, target volume coverage, percent
               of tumor coverage, and Dice similarity coefficient were
               calculated as metrics representing overall adequacy of ablation.
               In addition, 3D distance map around the tumor was computed and
               superimposed on the ablation volume to identify the area with
               insufficient margins. For patients with local recurrences, the
               follow-up images were registered to the post-procedural image.
               Three-dimensional minimum distance between the recurrence and the
               areas with insufficient margins was quantified. RESULTS: The
               percent tumor coverage for all nonrecurrent cases was 100 \%.
               Five cases had tumor recurrences, and the 3D distance map
               revealed insufficient tumor coverage or a 0-mm margin. It also
               showed that two recurrences were remote to the insufficient
               margin. CONCLUSIONS: Non-rigid registration and 3D distance map
               allow us to quantitatively evaluate the adequacy of the ablation
               margin after percutaneous liver ablation. The method may be
               useful to predict local recurrences immediately following
               ablation procedure.",

               resonance (MR)-tracked (MRTR) stylets. We explored the role of
               MRTR in a prospective clinical trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS:
               Eleven gynecologic cancer patients underwent MRTR to rapidly
               optimize interstitial catheter placement. MRTR catheter tip
               location and orientation were computed and overlaid on images
               displayed on in-room monitors at rates of 6 to 16 frames per
               second. Three modes of actively tracked navigation were analyzed:
               coarse navigation to the approximate region around the tumor;
               fine-tuning, bringing the stylets to the desired location; and
               pullback, with MRTR stylets rapidly withdrawn from within the
               catheters, providing catheter trajectories for radiation
               treatment planning (RTP). Catheters with conventional stylets
               were inserted, forming baseline locations. MRTR stylets were
               substituted, and catheter navigation was performed by a clinician
               working inside the MRI bore, using monitor feedback. RESULTS:
               Coarse navigation allowed repositioning of the MRTR catheters
               tips by 16 mm (mean), relative to baseline, in 14 $\pm$ 5
               s/catheter (mean $\pm$ standard deviation [SD]). The fine-tuning
               mode repositioned the catheter tips by a further 12 mm, in 24
               $\pm$ 17 s/catheter. Pullback mode provided catheter trajectories
               with RTP point resolution of ∼1.5 mm, in 1 to 9 s/catheter.
               CONCLUSIONS: MRTR-based navigation resulted in rapid and optimal
               placement of interstitial brachytherapy catheters. Catheters were
               repositioned compared with the initial insertion without
               tracking. In pullback mode, catheter trajectories matched
               computed tomographic precision, enabling their use for RTP.",

   abstract = "PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation for liver tumors (liver RFA) is
               widely performed under ultrasound guidance. However,
               discriminating between the tumor and the needle is often
               difficult because of cavitation caused by RFA-induced
               coagulation. An unclear ultrasound image can lead to
               complications and tumor residue. Therefore, image-guided
               navigation systems based on fiducial registration have been
               developed. Fiducial points are usually set on a patient's skin.
               But the use of internal fiducial points can improve the accuracy
               of navigation. In this study, a new device is introduced to use
               internal fiducial points using 2D US. METHODS: 3D Slicer as the
               navigation software, Polaris Vicra as the position sensor, and
               two target tumors in a 3D abdominal phantom as puncture targets
               were used. Also, a new device that makes it possible to obtain
               tracking coordinates in the body was invented. First,
               two-dimensional reslice images from the CT images using 3D Slicer
               were built. A virtual needle was displayed on the two-dimensional
               reslice image, reflecting the movement of the actual needle after
               fiducial registration. A phantom experiment using three sets of
               fiducial point configurations: one conventional case using only
               surface points, and two cases in which the center of the target
               tumor was selected as a fiducial point was performed. For each
               configuration, one surgeon punctured each target tumor ten times
               under guidance from the 3D Slicer display. Finally, a statistical
               analysis examining the puncture error was performed. RESULTS: The
               puncture error for each target tumor decreased significantly when
               the center of the target tumor was included as one of the
               fiducial points, compared with when only surface points were
               used. CONCLUSION: This study introduces a new device to use
               internal fiducial points and suggests that the accuracy of
               image-guided navigation systems for liver RFA can be improved by
               using the new device.",

               automated registration between planning and intra-procedural
               T2-weighted prostate MRI was developed and evaluated on the
               images acquired during 10 consecutive MR-guided biopsies.
               Registration accuracy was quantified at image-based landmarks and
               by evaluating spatial overlap for the manually segmented prostate
               and sub-structures. Registration reliability was evaluated by
               simulating initial mis-registration and analyzing the convergence
               behavior. Registration precision was characterized at the planned
               biopsy targets. RESULTS: The total computation time was
               compatible with a clinical setting, being at most 2 min.
               Deformable registration led to a significant improvement in
               spatial overlap of the prostate and peripheral zone contours
               compared with both rigid and affine registration. Average
               in-slice landmark registration error was 1.3 $\pm$ 0.5 mm.
               Experiments simulating initial mis-registration resulted in an
               estimated average capture range of 6 mm and an average in-slice
               registration precision of $\pm$0.3 mm. CONCLUSION: Our
               registration approach requires minimum user interaction and is
               compatible with the time constraints of our interventional

               accurate magnetic resonance (MR) image-guided microwave
               thermocoagulation therapy of liver tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
               An open configuration MR scanner and a microwave coagulator at
               2.45 GHz were used. Navigation software, a 3D Slicer, was
               customized to combine fluoroscopic MR images and preoperative MR
               images for the navigation. New functions to display MR
               temperature maps with simple parameter setting, and to record and
               display the coagulated areas by multiple microwave ablations in
               the 3-dimensional space (footprinting), were also introduced into
               the software. The VGA signal of the computer display was directly
               transferred to the surgeon's monitor. RESULTS: The customized
               software could be used for both accurate image navigation and
               convenient and easy temperature monitoring. Because repeated
               punctures and ablations are usually required in this procedure,
               the footprinting function made targeting of the tumors both easy

               area of research. However, there has been little research on
               motion tracking and compensation in magnetic resonance imaging

               assist this process, we have developed a motorized MR-compatible
               manipulator. METHODS: The manipulator consists of a passive end
               effecter with 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) rotation and active base
               stages with 3 ultrasonic motors. It automatically chases the

               to assess its accuracy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nonrigid
               registration of preoperative MRI to intraoperative MRI images was
               carried out in 16 cases using a Basis-Spline algorithm in a
               retrospective manner. The registration was assessed qualitatively
               by experts' visual inspection and quantitatively by measuring the
               Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for total gland (TG), central
               gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), the mutual information (MI)
               metric, and the fiducial registration error (FRE) between
               corresponding anatomical landmarks for both the nonrigid and a
               rigid registration method. RESULTS: All 16 cases were
               successfully registered in less than 5 min. After the nonrigid
               registration, DSC values for TG, CG, PZ were 0.91, 0.89, 0.79,
               respectively, the MI metric was -0.19 +/- 0.07 and FRE presented
               a value of 2.3 +/- 1.8 mm. All the metrics were significantly
               better than in the case of rigid registration, as determined by
               one-sided t-tests. CONCLUSION: The intensity-based nonrigid
               registration method using clinical data was demonstrated to be
               feasible and showed statistically improved metrics when compare
               to only rigid registration. The method is a valuable tool to
               integrate pre- and intraoperative images for brachytherapy.",

               the workspace optimization and phantom evaluation of a five
               Degree of Freedom (DOF) parallel pneumatically actuated modular
               robot for MRI-guided prostate biopsy. To shorten procedure time
               and consequently increase patient comfort and system accuracy, a
               prototype of a MRI-compatible master-slave needle driver module
               using piezo motors was also added to the base robot. RESULTS:
               Variable size workspace was achieved using appropriate link
               length, compared with the previous design. The 5-DOF targeting
               accuracy demonstrated an average error of 2.5 mm (STD = 1.37 mm)

               guided by synchronizing the 4D image with the actual organ motion

               feasibility and determine optimal imaging conditions, studies

               An open-configuration MR imager with an optical tracking system
               for image plane control and a microwave coagulator operating at
               2.45 GHz were used. Liver tumors were percutaneously punctured
               under the guidance of MR images and ablated. Handpiece adapters

               resonance (MR) image-guided liver therapy enhances surgical
               guidance by fusing preoperative multimodality images with
               intraoperative images, or by fusing intramodality images to
               correlate serial intraoperative images to monitor the effect of
               therapy. The objective of this paper is to describe the
               application of navigator echo and projection profile matching to
               fast two-dimensional image registration for MR-guided liver
               therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtain navigator echoes along
               the read-out and phase-encoding directions by using modified
               gradient echo imaging. This registration is made possible by
               masking out the liver profile from the image and performing
               profile matching with cross-correlation or mutual information as
               similarity measures. The set of experiments include a phantom
               study with a 2.0-T experimental MR scanner, and a volunteer and a
               clinical study with a 0.5-T open-configuration MR scanner, and
               these evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of this method for
               liver therapy. RESULTS: Both the phantom and volunteer study
               indicate that this method can perform registration in 34 ms with
               root-mean-square error of 1.6 mm when the given misalignment of a
               liver is 30 mm. The clinical studies demonstrate that the method
               can track liver motion of up to approximately 40 mm. Matching
               profiles with cross-correlation information perform better than
               with mutual information in terms of robustness and speed.

               needle insertion path while maintaining remote center of motion
               (RCM) at the tumor site. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The manipulator
               consists of a three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) base stage and
               passive needle holder with unconstrained two-DOF rotation. The
               synergistic control keeps the Virtual RCM at the preplanned
               target using encoder outputs from the needle holder as input to
               motorize the base stage. RESULTS: The manipulator assists in
               searching for an optimal needle insertion path which is a complex
               and time-consuming task in MRI-guided ablation therapy for liver
               tumors. The assessment study showed that accuracy of keeping the
               virtual RCM to predefined position is 3.0 mm. In a phantom test,
               the physicians found the needle insertion path faster with than
               without the manipulator (number of physicians = 3, P = 0.001).
               However, the alignment time with the virtual RCM was not shorter

               robotic systems have been developed and optimal use of the
               confined in-bore space become a critical engineering challenge.
               METHODS: As preliminary evaluation of our prostate intervention
               robot, we conducted a workspace design analysis, using a new
               evaluation method that we developed for in-bore-operated robots
               for transperineal prostate interventions, and an MRI
               compatibility study. RESULTS: The workspace analysis resulted in
               the effective workspace (VW ) of 0.32, which is greater than that
               of our early prototype, despite the current robot being ca. 50\%
               larger than the early prototype in sectional space. The MRI
               compatibility study resulted in < 15\% signal:noise ratio (SNR)

               2D turbo FLASH perfusion images were acquired with shallow free
               breathing. B-spline nonrigid image registration and optimization
               by $\chi$² test against pharmacokinetic model curve were
               performed on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. This allowed
               voxel-by-voxel calculation of k(ep) , the rate constant for
               tracer transport to and from plasma and the extravascular
               extracellular space. Mean transit time, time-to-peak, initial
               slope, and maximum enhancement (E(max) ) were calculated from
               time-intensity curves fitted to a gamma variate function. After
               blinded data analysis, correlation with tissue histology from
               surgical resection or biopsy samples was performed. Histologic
               evaluation revealed 25 malignant and five benign SPNs. All benign
               SPNs had k(ep) 1.0 min⁻¹. Sensitivity to diagnose malignant SPNs
               at a cutoff of k(ep) = 1.0 min⁻¹ was 76\%, specificity was 100\%,
               positive predictive value was 100\%, negative predictive value
               was 45\%, and accuracy was 80\%. Of all indices studied, k(ep)
               was the most significant in differentiating malignant from benign
               SPNs.",

               on pixel-wise pharmacokinetic analysis of free-breathing DCE-MRI
               in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). Misalignment
               of focal lesions due to respiratory motion in free-breathing
               dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) precludes obtaining
               reliable time-intensity curves, which are crucial for
               pharmacokinetic analysis for tissue characterization. MATERIALS
               AND METHODS: Single-slice 2D DCE-MRI was obtained in 15 patients.
               Misalignments of SPNs were corrected using nonrigid B-spline
               image registration. Pixel-wise pharmacokinetic parameters
               K(trans) , v(e) , and k(ep) were estimated from both original and
               motion-corrected DCE-MRI by fitting the two-compartment
               pharmacokinetic model to the time-intensity curve obtained in
               each pixel. The ``goodness-of-fit'' was tested with $\chi$(2)
               -test in pixel-by-pixel basis to evaluate the reliability of the
               parameters. The percentages of reliable pixels within the SPNs
               were compared between the original and motion-corrected DCE-MRI.
               In addition, the parameters obtained from benign and malignant
               SPNs were compared. RESULTS: The percentage of reliable pixels in
               the motion-corrected DCE-MRI was significantly larger than the
               original DCE-MRI (P = 4 $\times$ 10(-7) ). Both K(trans) and
               k(ep) derived from the motion-corrected DCE-MRI showed
               significant differences between benign and malignant SPNs (P =
               0.024, 0.015). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the impact of

               insertion due to the constrained in-bore space, causing a safety
               hazard and limiting image feedback. To address this issue, we
               present our custom-made in-bore setup and software to support
               MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy in a wide-bore 3 T MRI
               scanner. The setup consists of a specially designed tabletop and
               a needle-guiding template with a Z-frame that gives a physician
               access to the perineum of the patient at the imaging position and
               allows the physician to perform MRI-guided transperineal biopsy
               without moving the patient out of the scanner. The software and
               Z-frame allow registration of the template, target planning and
               biopsy guidance. Initially, we performed phantom experiments to
               assess the accuracy of template registration and needle placement
               in a controlled environment. Subsequently, we embarked on our
               clinical trial (N = 10). The phantom experiments showed that the
               translational errors of the template registration along the
               right-left (RP) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes were 1.1 $\pm$
               0.8 and 1.4 $\pm$ 1.1 mm, respectively, while the rotational
               errors around the RL, AP and superior-inferior axes were (0.8
               $\pm$ 1.0)°, (1.7 $\pm$ 1.6)° and (0.0 $\pm$ 0.0)°, respectively.
               The 2D root-mean-square (RMS) needle-placement error was 3 mm.
               The clinical biopsy procedures were safely carried out in all ten
               clinical cases with a needle-placement error of 5.4 mm (2D RMS).
               In conclusion, transperineal prostate biopsy in a wide-bore 3T
               scanner is feasible using our custom-made tabletop setup and

                experience using a 3-T whole-body scanner equipped with a
                128-channel coil applied to lung motion assessment. Recent
                improvements in fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology
                have enabled several trials of free-breathing three-dimensional
                (3D) imaging of the lung. A large number of image frames
                necessarily increases the difficulty of image analysis and
                therefore warrants automatic image processing. However, the
                intensity homogeneities of images of prior dynamic 3D lung MRI
                studies have been insufficient to use such methods. In this
                study, initial data were obtained at 3 T with a 128-channel coil
                that demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring multiple sets of
                3D pulmonary scans during free breathing and that have
                sufficient quality to be amenable to automatic segmentation.
                MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic 3D images of the lungs of two
                volunteers were acquired with acquisition times of 0.62 to 0.76
                frames/s and an image matrix of 128 x 128, with 24 to 30 slice
                encodings. The volunteers were instructed to take shallow and
                deep breaths during the scans. The variation of lung volume was
                measured from the segmented images. RESULTS: Dynamic 3D images
                were successfully acquired for both respiratory conditions for
                each subject. The images showed whole-lung motion, including
                lifting of the chest wall and the displacement of the diaphragm,
                with sufficient contrast to distinguish these structures from
                adjacent tissues. The average time to complete segmentation for
                one 3D image was 4.8 seconds. The tidal volume measured was
                consistent with known tidal volumes for healthy subjects
                performing deep-breathing maneuvers. The temporal resolution was
                insufficient to measure tidal volumes for shallow breathing.
                CONCLUSION: This initial experience with a 3-T whole-body
                scanner and a 128-channel coil showed that the scanner and
                imaging protocol provided dynamic 3D images with spatial and
                temporal resolution sufficient to delineate the diaphragmatic
                domes and chest wall during active breathing. In addition, the
                intensity homogeneities and signal-to-noise ratio were adequate
                to perform automatic segmentation.",

               by applying a line set registration algorithm to the detected

               standardized communication among devices and software to share
               data such as target positions, images and device status. METHOD:
               We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network
               communication protocol for IGT, named OpenIGTLink, to transfer
               transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance
               tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering
               scenarios. RESULTS: The protocol was able to transfer position
               data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with
               latency of <10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated that
               the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and software.
               CONCLUSION: The protocol proved capable of handling data required
               in the IGT setting with sufficient time resolution and latency.
               The protocol not only improves the interoperability of devices

               The protocol provides a standardized mechanism to connect
               hardware and software by the transfer of coordinate transforms,
               images, and status messages. MeVisLab is a framework for the
               development of image processing algorithms and visualization and
               interaction methods, with a focus on medical imaging. METHODS:
               The paper describes the integration of the OpenIGTLink network
               protocol for IGT with the medical prototyping platform MeVisLab.
               The integration of OpenIGTLink into MeVisLab has been realized by
               developing a software module using the C++ programming language.
               RESULTS: The integration was evaluated with tracker clients that
               are available online. Furthermore, the integration was used to
               connect MeVisLab to Slicer and a NDI tracking system over the
               network. The latency time during navigation with a real
               instrument was measured to show that the integration can be used

               their software to hardware devices that already support the
               OpenIGTLink protocol, such as the NDI Aurora magnetic tracking

   abstract = "OBJECT: In these days, patients and doctors in operation room are
               surrounded by many medical devices as resulting from recent
               advancement of medical technology. However, these cutting-edge
               medical devices are working independently and not collaborating
               with each other, even though the collaborations between these
               devices such as navigation systems and medical imaging devices
               are becoming very important for accomplishing complex surgical
               tasks (such as a tumor removal procedure while checking the tumor
               location in neurosurgery). On the other hand, several surgical
               robots have been commercialized, and are becoming common.
               However, these surgical robots are not open for collaborations
               with external medical devices in these days. A cutting-edge
               ``intelligent surgical robot'' will be possible in collaborating
               with surgical robots, various kinds of sensors, navigation system
               and so on. On the other hand, most of the academic software
               developments for surgical robots are ``home-made'' in their
               research institutions and not open to the public. Therefore, open
               source control software for surgical robots can be beneficial in
               this field. From these perspectives, we developed Open Core
               Control software for surgical robots to overcome these
               challenges. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In general, control softwares
               have hardware dependencies based on actuators, sensors and
               various kinds of internal devices. Therefore, these control
               softwares cannot be used on different types of robots without
               modifications. However, the structure of the Open Core Control
               software can be reused for various types of robots by abstracting
               hardware dependent parts. In addition, network connectivity is
               crucial for collaboration between advanced medical devices. The
               OpenIGTLink is adopted in Interface class which plays a role to
               communicate with external medical devices. At the same time, it
               is essential to maintain the stable operation within the
               asynchronous data transactions through network. In the Open Core
               Control software, several techniques for this purpose were
               introduced. Virtual fixture is well known technique as a ``force
               guide'' for supporting operators to perform precise manipulation
               by using a master-slave robot. The virtual fixture for precise
               and safety surgery was implemented on the system to demonstrate
               an idea of high-level collaboration between a surgical robot and
               a navigation system. The extension of virtual fixture is not a
               part of the Open Core Control system, however, the function such
               as virtual fixture cannot be realized without a tight
               collaboration between cutting-edge medical devices. By using the
               virtual fixture, operators can pre-define an accessible area on
               the navigation system, and the area information can be
               transferred to the robot. In this manner, the surgical console
               generates the reflection force when the operator tries to get out
               from the pre-defined accessible area during surgery. RESULTS: The
               Open Core Control software was implemented on a surgical
               master-slave robot and stable operation was observed in a motion
               test. The tip of the surgical robot was displayed on a navigation
               system by connecting the surgical robot with a 3D position sensor
               through the OpenIGTLink. The accessible area was pre-defined
               before the operation, and the virtual fixture was displayed as a
               ``force guide'' on the surgical console. In addition, the system
               showed stable performance in a duration test with network
               disturbance. CONCLUSION: In this paper, a design of the Open Core
               Control software for surgical robots and the implementation of
               virtual fixture were described. The Open Core Control software
               was implemented on a surgical robot system and showed stable
               performance in high-level collaboration works. The Open Core
               Control software is developed to be a widely used platform of
               surgical robots. Safety issues are essential for control software
               of these complex medical devices. It is important to follow the
               global specifications such as a FDA requirement ``General
               Principles of Software Validation'' or IEC62304. For following
               these regulations, it is important to develop a self-test
               environment. Therefore, a test environment is now under
               development to test various interference in operation room such
               as a noise of electric knife by considering safety and test
               environment regulations such as ISO13849 and IEC60508. The Open
               Core Control software is currently being developed software in
               open-source manner and available on the Internet. A communization
               of software interface is becoming a major trend in this field.
               Based on this perspective, the Open Core Control software can be
               expected to bring contributions in this field.",

   abstract = "PURPOSE: The integration of a robot into an image-guided therapy
               system is still a time consuming process, due to the lack of a
               well-accepted standard for interdevice communication. The aim of
               this project is to simplify this procedure by developing an open
               interface based on three interface classes: state control,
               visualisation, and sensor. A state machine on the robot control
               is added to the concept because the robot has its own workflow
               during surgical procedures, which differs from the workflow of
               the surgeon. METHODS: A KUKA Light Weight Robot is integrated
               into the medical technology environment of the Institute of
               Mechatronic Systems as a proof of concept. Therefore, 3D Slicer
               was used as visualisation and state control software. For the
               network communication the OpenIGTLink protocol was implemented.
               In order to achieve high rate control of the robot the ``KUKA
               Sunrise. Connectivity SmartServo'' package was used. An exemplary
               state machine providing states typically used by image-guided
               therapy interventions, was implemented. Two interface classes,
               which allow for a direct use of OpenIGTLink for robot control on
               the one hand and visualisation on the other hand were developed.
               Additionally, a 3D Slicer module was written to operate the state
               control. RESULTS: Utilising the described software concept the
               state machine could be operated by the 3D Slicer module with 20
               Hz cycle rate and no data loss was detected during a test phase
               of approximately 270s (13,640 packages). Furthermore, the current
               robot pose could be sent with more than 60 Hz. No influence on
               the performance of the state machine by the communication thread
               could be measured. CONCLUSION: Simplified integration was
               achieved by using only one programming context for the
               implementation of the state machine, the interfaces, and the
               robot control. Eventually, the exemplary state machine can be
               easily expanded by adding new states.",

               MRI-compatible pneumatic robot for needle placement that can
               angulate a needle insertion path into a large accessible target
               volume. METHODS: We extended our MRI-compatible pneumatic robot
               for needle placement to utilize its four degrees-of-freedom
               (4-DOF) mechanism with two parallel triangular structures and
               support transperineal prostate biopsies in a closed-bore magnetic
               resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The robot is designed to guide a
               needle toward a lesion so that a radiologist can manually insert
               it in the bore. The robot is integrated with navigation software
               that allows an operator to plan angulated needle insertion by
               selecting a target and an entry point. The targeting error was
               evaluated while the angle between the needle insertion path and
               the static magnetic field was between -5.7° and 5.7° horizontally
               and between -5.7° and 4.3° vertically in the MRI scanner after
               sterilizing and draping the device. RESULTS: The robot positioned
               the needle for angulated insertion as specified on the navigation
               software with overall targeting error of 0.8 $\pm$ 0.5mm along
               the horizontal axis and 0.8 $\pm$ 0.8mm along the vertical axis.
               The two-dimensional root-mean-square targeting error on the axial
               slices as containing the targets was 1.4mm. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               preclinical evaluation demonstrated that the MRI-compatible
               pneumatic robot for needle placement with the capability to
               angulate the needle insertion path provides targeting accuracy

               clinical feasibility has to be established in a clinical study.",

               of modular hardware and software to support the surgical workflow
               of intra-operative MRI-guided surgical procedures. We present the
               development of a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) needle placement robot
               for transperineal prostate interventions. The robot consists of a
               3-DOF needle driver module and a 3-DOF Cartesian motion module.
               The needle driver provides needle cannula translation and
               rotation (2-DOF) and stylet translation (1-DOF). A custom robot
               controller consisting of multiple piezoelectric motor drivers
               provides precision closed-loop control of piezoelectric motors
               and enables simultaneous robot motion and MR imaging. The
               developed modular robot control interface software performs
               image-based registration, kinematics calculation, and exchanges
               robot commands and coordinates between the navigation software

               retrospective-prospective study included 99 cases of targeted
               transperineal prostate biopsies. The biopsy needles were aimed at
               suspicious foci noted on multiparametric 3T MRI using manual
               template (historical control) as compared with a robotic
               template. The following data were obtained: the accuracy of
               average and closest needle placement to the focus, histologic
               yield, percentage of cancer volume in positive core samples,
               complication rate, and time to complete the procedure. RESULTS:
               In all, 56 cases were performed using the manual template and 43
               cases were performed using the robotic template. The mean
               accuracy of the best needle placement attempt was higher in the

               (90.82 min) than the manual group (100.63 min, P < 0.030).
               Percentage of cancer volume in positive core samples was higher
               in the robotic group (P < 0.001). Cancer yields and complication

               biopsy in a clinically heterogeneous patient population.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective retrospectively analyzed
               study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board
               approved, and informed consent was obtained. Eighty-seven men
               (mean age, 66.2 years $\pm$ 6.9) underwent multiparametric
               endorectal prostate MR imaging at 3 T and transperineal MR
               imaging-guided biopsy. Three subgroups of patients with at least
               one lesion suspicious for cancer were included: men with no prior
               PCa prostate cancer diagnosis, men with PCa prostate cancer who
               were undergoing active surveillance, and men with treated PCa
               prostate cancer and suspected recurrence. Exclusion criteria were
               prior prostatectomy and/or contraindication to 3-T MR imaging.
               The transperineal MR imaging-guided biopsy was performed in a
               70-cm wide-bore 3-T device. Overall patient biopsy outcomes,
               cancer detection rates, Gleason grade, and location for each
               subgroup were evaluated and statistically compared by using
               $\chi$(2) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey
               honestly significant difference post hoc comparisons. RESULTS:
               Ninety biopsy procedures were performed with no serious adverse
               events, with a mean of 3.7 targets sampled per gland. Cancer was
               detected in 51 (56.7\%) men: 48.1\% (25 of 52) with no prior PCa
               prostate cancer , 61.5\% (eight of 13) under active surveillance,
               and 72.0\% (18 of 25) in whom recurrence was suspected. Gleason
               pattern 4 or higher was diagnosed in 78.1\% (25 of 32) in the no
               prior PCa prostate cancer and active surveillance groups. Gleason
               scores were not assigned in the suspected recurrence group. MR
               targets located in the anterior prostate had the highest cancer
               yield (40 of 64, 62.5\%) compared with those for the other parts
               of the prostate (P < .001). CONCLUSION: In-bore 3-T transperineal
               MR imaging-guided biopsy, with a mean of 3.7 targets per gland,
               allowed detection of many clinically relevant cancers, many of

   abstract = "BACKGROUND: Accurate needle placement is the first concern in
               percutaneous MRI-guided prostate interventions. In this phantom
               study, different sources contributing to the overall needle
               placement error of a MRI-guided robot for prostate biopsy have
               been identified, quantified and minimized to the possible extent.
               METHODS: The overall needle placement error of the system was
               evaluated in a prostate phantom. This error was broken into two
               parts: the error associated with the robotic system (called
               'before-insertion error') and the error associated with
               needle-tissue interaction (called 'due-to-insertion error').
               Before-insertion error was measured directly in a soft phantom
               and different sources contributing into this part were identified
               and quantified. A calibration methodology was developed to
               minimize the 4-DOF manipulator's error. The due-to-insertion
               error was indirectly approximated by comparing the overall error
               and the before-insertion error. The effect of sterilization on
               the manipulator's accuracy and repeatability was also studied.
               RESULTS: The average overall system error in the phantom study
               was 2.5 mm (STD = 1.1 mm). The average robotic system error in
               the Super Soft plastic phantom was 1.3 mm (STD = 0.7 mm).
               Assuming orthogonal error components, the needle-tissue
               interaction error was found to be approximately 2.13 mm, thus
               making a larger contribution to the overall error. The average
               susceptibility artifact shift was 0.2 mm. The manipulator's
               targeting accuracy was 0.71 mm (STD = 0.21 mm) after robot
               calibration. The robot's repeatability was 0.13 mm. Sterilization
               had no noticeable influence on the robot's accuracy and
               repeatability. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental methodology
               presented in this paper may help researchers to identify,
               quantify and minimize different sources contributing into the
               overall needle placement error of an MRI-guided robotic system
               for prostate needle placement. In the robotic system analysed
               here, the overall error of the studied system remained within the

               human error in the use of a conventional needle guide template in
               magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided prostate intervention, we
               developed a motorized MRI-compatible needle guide template that
               resembles a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate template. The
               motorized template allows automated, gapless needle guidance in a
               3T MRI scanner with minimal changes in the current clinical
               procedure. To evaluate the impact of the motorized template on
               MRI, signal-to-noise ratio and distortion were measured under
               various system configurations. A maximum of 44\% signal-to-noise
               ratio decrease was found when the ultrasonic motors were running,
               and a maximum of 0.4\% image distortion was observed due to the
               presence of the motorized template. To measure needle insertion
               accuracy, we performed four sets of five random target needle
               insertions mimicking four biopsy procedures, which resulted in an
               average in-plane targeting error of 0.94 mm with a standard
               deviation of 0.34 mm. The evaluation studies indicated that the
               presence and operation of the motorized template in the MRI bore
               create insignificant image degradation, and provide submillimeter
               targeting accuracy. The automated needle guide that is directly
               controlled by navigation software eliminates human error so that

               placement of metallic devices for radiation therapy. METHODS: An
               actively tracked metallic stylet for brachytherapy was
               constructed by adding printed-circuit micro-coils to a commercial
               stylet. The coil design was optimized by electromagnetic
               simulation, and has a radio-frequency lobe pattern extending ∼5
               mm beyond the strong B0 inhomogeneity region near the metal
               surface. An MR-tracking sequence with phase-field dithering was
               used to overcome residual effects of B0 and B1 inhomogeneities
               caused by the metal, as well as from inductive coupling to
               surrounding metallic stylets. The tracking system was integrated
               with a graphical workstation for real-time visualization. The 3
               Tesla MRI catheter-insertion procedures were tested in phantoms
               and ex vivo animal tissue, and then performed in three patients
               during interstitial brachytherapy. RESULTS: The tracking system
               provided high-resolution (0.6 $\times$ 0.6 $\times$ 0.6 mm(3) )
               and rapid (16 to 40 frames per second, with three to one

               the intraprocedural nonrigid magnetic resonance (MR) to computed
               tomography (CT) image registration in the assessment of tumor
               margins during CT-guided liver tumor ablations. Although both
               accuracy and speed can be improved by limiting the registration
               to a region of interest (ROI), manual contouring of the ROI
               prolongs the registration process substantially. To achieve
               accurate and fast registration without the use of an ROI, we
               combined a nonrigid registration technique on the basis of volume
               subdivision with hardware acceleration using a graphics
               processing unit (GPU). We compared the registration accuracy and
               processing time of GPU-accelerated volume subdivision-based
               nonrigid registration technique to the conventional nonrigid
               B-spline registration technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen
               image data sets of preprocedural MR and intraprocedural CT images
               for percutaneous CT-guided liver tumor ablations were obtained.
               Each set of images was registered using the GPU-accelerated
               volume subdivision technique and the B-spline technique. Manual
               contouring of ROI was used only for the B-spline technique.
               Registration accuracies (Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] and
               95\% Hausdorff distance [HD]) and total processing time including
               contouring of ROIs and computation were compared using a paired
               Student t test. RESULTS: Accuracies of the GPU-accelerated
               registrations and B-spline registrations, respectively, were 88.3
               $\pm$ 3.7\% versus 89.3 $\pm$ 4.9\% (P = .41) for DSC and 13.1
               $\pm$ 5.2 versus 11.4 $\pm$ 6.3 mm (P = .15) for HD. Total
               processing time of the GPU-accelerated registration and B-spline
               registration techniques was 88 $\pm$ 14 versus 557 $\pm$ 116
               seconds (P < .000000002), respectively; there was no significant
               difference in computation time despite the difference in the
               complexity of the algorithms (P = .71). CONCLUSIONS: The
               GPU-accelerated volume subdivision technique was as accurate as
               the B-spline technique and required significantly less processing
               time. The GPU-accelerated volume subdivision technique may enable
               the implementation of nonrigid registration into routine clinical
               practice.",

               recognized as a feasible solution for diagnosis and treatment of
               prostate cancer in humans. METHODS: This paper discusses the
               kinematics of a parallel 4 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) surgical
               manipulator designed for minimally invasive in-bore prostate
               percutaneous interventions through the patient's perineum. The
               proposed manipulator takes advantage of four sliders actuated by
               MRI-compatible piezoelectric motors and incremental rotary
               encoders. Errors, mostly originating from the design and
               manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before
               the robot is deployed in clinical trials. RESULTS: The
               manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the
               repeatability and accuracy (about 1 mm in air (in x or y
               direction) at the needle's reference point) of needle placement,
               which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate
               interventions. CONCLUSION: The acquired results endorse the
               sustainability, precision and reliability of the manipulator.

               is the modality of choice for visualizing tumors and their
               surroundings because of superior soft-tissue contrast. Real-time
               MR guidance of catheter placement in interstitial brachytherapy
               facilitates target coverage, and would be further improved by
               providing intraprocedural estimates of dosimetric coverage. A
               major obstacle to intraprocedural dosimetry is the time needed
               for catheter trajectory reconstruction. Herein the authors
               evaluate an active MR tracking (MRTR) system which provides rapid
               catheter tip localization and trajectory reconstruction. The
               authors assess the reliability and spatial accuracy of the MRTR
               system in comparison to standard catheter digitization using
               magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT. METHODS: The MRTR system
               includes a stylet with microcoils mounted on its shaft, which can
               be inserted into brachytherapy catheters and tracked by a
               dedicated MRTR sequence. Catheter tip localization errors of the
               MRTR system and their dependence on catheter locations and
               orientation inside the MR scanner were quantified with a water
               phantom. The distances between the tracked tip positions of the
               MRTR stylet and the predefined ground-truth tip positions were
               calculated for measurements performed at seven locations and with
               nine orientations. To evaluate catheter trajectory
               reconstruction, fifteen brachytherapy catheters were placed into
               a gel phantom with an embedded catheter fixation framework, with
               parallel or crossed paths. The MRTR stylet was then inserted
               sequentially into each catheter. During the removal of the MRTR
               stylet from within each catheter, a MRTR measurement was
               performed at 40 Hz to acquire the instantaneous stylet tip
               position, resulting in a series of three-dimensional (3D)
               positions along the catheter's trajectory. A 3D polynomial curve
               was fit to the tracked positions for each catheter, and equally
               spaced dwell points were then generated along the curve.
               High-resolution 3D MRI of the phantom was performed followed by
               catheter digitization based on the catheter's imaging artifacts.
               The catheter trajectory error was characterized in terms of the
               mean distance between corresponding dwell points in
               MRTR-generated catheter trajectory and MRI-based catheter
               digitization. The MRTR-based catheter trajectory reconstruction
               process was also performed on three gynecologic cancer patients,
               and then compared with catheter digitization based on MRI and CT.
               RESULTS: The catheter tip localization error increased as the
               MRTR stylet moved further off-center and as the stylet's
               orientation deviated from the main magnetic field direction.
               Fifteen catheters' trajectories were reconstructed by MRTR.
               Compared with MRI-based digitization, the mean 3D error of
               MRTR-generated trajectories was 1.5 $\pm$ 0.5 mm with an in-plane
               error of 0.7 $\pm$ 0.2 mm and a tip error of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.5 mm.
               MRTR resolved ambiguity in catheter assignment due to crossed
               catheter paths, which is a common problem in image-based catheter
               digitization. In the patient studies, the MRTR-generated catheter
               trajectory was consistent with digitization based on both MRI and
               CT. CONCLUSIONS: The MRTR system provides accurate catheter tip
               localization and trajectory reconstruction in the MR environment.
               Relative to the image-based methods, it improves the speed,
               safety, and reliability of the catheter trajectory reconstruction
               in interstitial brachytherapy. MRTR may enable in-procedural

   abstract = "PURPOSE: Image-guided cryotherapy of renal cancer is an emerging
               alternative to surgical nephrectomy, particularly for those who
               cannot sustain the physical burden of surgery. It is well known
               that the outcome of this therapy depends on the accurate
               placement of the cryotherapy probe. Therefore, a robotic
               instrument guide may help physicians aim the cryotherapy probe
               precisely to maximize the efficacy of the treatment and avoid
               damage to critical surrounding structures. The objective of this
               paper was to propose a robotic instrument guide for orienting
               cryotherapy probes in image-guided cryotherapy of renal cancers.
               The authors propose a body-mounted robotic guide that is expected
               to be less susceptible to guidance errors caused by the patient's
               whole body motion. METHODS: Keeping the device's minimal
               footprint in mind, the authors developed and validated a
               body-mounted, robotic instrument guide that can maintain the
               geometrical relationship between the device and the patient's
               body, even in the presence of the patient's frequent body
               motions. The guide can orient the cryotherapy probe with the skin
               incision point as the remote-center-of-motion. The authors'
               validation studies included an evaluation of the mechanical
               accuracy and position repeatability of the robotic instrument
               guide. The authors also performed a mock MRI-guided cryotherapy
               procedure with a phantom to compare the advantage of robotically
               assisted probe replacements over a free-hand approach, by
               introducing organ motions to investigate their effects on the
               accurate placement of the cryotherapy probe. Measurements
               collected for performance analysis included accuracy and time
               taken for probe placements. Multivariate analysis was performed
               to assess if either or both organ motion and the robotic guide
               impacted these measurements. RESULTS: The mechanical accuracy and
               position repeatability of the probe placement using the robotic
               instrument guide were 0.3 and 0.1 mm, respectively, at a depth of
               80 mm. The phantom test indicated that the accuracy of probe
               placement was significantly better with the robotic instrument
               guide (4.1 mm) than without the guide (6.3 mm, p<0.001), even in
               the presence of body motion. When independent organ motion was
               artificially added, in addition to body motion, the advantage of
               accurate probe placement using the robotic instrument guide
               disappeared statistically [i.e., 6.0 mm with the robotic guide
               and 5.9 mm without the robotic guide (p = 0.906)]. When the
               robotic instrument guide was used, the total time required to
               complete the procedure was reduced from 19.6 to 12.7 min
               (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated that the robotic
               instrument guide, not the organ motion, was the cause of
               statistical significance. The statistical power the authors
               obtained was 88\% in accuracy assessment and 99\% higher in
               duration measurement. CONCLUSIONS: The body-mounted robotic
               instrument guide allows positioning of the probe during
               image-guided cryotherapy of renal cancer and was done in fewer
               attempts and in less time than the free-hand approach. The
               accuracy of the placement of the cryotherapy probe was better
               using the robotic instrument guide than without the guide when no
               organ motion was present. The accuracy between the robotic and
               free-hand approach becomes comparable when organ motion was
               present.",
